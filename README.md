# LightsOnMic
Windows 10 app to set computer RGB lights (e.g. those found on Alienware devices) according to whether your microphone is in use by other applications. Allows you to use your RGB lights to indicate when you are taking part in a web meeting and should not be disturbed.

## Requirements

* Windows 10 is required.
* The built-in notification icon that indicates when the microphone is in use must be visible in the notification area (this is the default setting in Windows). If the user hides it in the notification overflow area, this app will not be able to detect when the microphone is in use.

## Development
LightsOnMic is developed using [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).
